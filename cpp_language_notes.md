# how to store read only data


Yes, on Linux, you can place initialized data in a read-only segment by using the const keyword in C or C++. This ensures that the data is placed in the read-only data section of the executable, typically the .rodata section.

Example in C/C++
Here's an example of how to place initialized data in a read-only segment using the const keyword:

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Initialized data in read-only segment
const char* message = "Hello, World!";

int main() {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Yes, on Linux, you can place initialized data in a read-only segment by using the const keyword in C or C++. This ensures that the data is placed in the read-only data section of the executable, typically the .rodata section.

Example in C/C++
Here's an example of how to place initialized data in a read-only segment using the const keyword:

In this example, the message variable is declared as const, which ensures that it is placed in the read-only data segment.

Verifying the Read-Only Segment
You can verify that the data is placed in the read-only segment by examining the sections of the compiled binary using the readelf or objdump tools.

Using readelf

```bash
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp
readelf -S my_program | grep rodata
```

Using objdump
```c++
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp
objdump -h my_program | grep rodata
```

Example Output
The output should show a section named .rodata, indicating that the read-only data is placed in this segment.
```c++
  [15] .rodata           PROGBITS        0000000000402000  00002000
```
Yes, on Linux, you can place initialized data in a read-only segment by using the `const` keyword in C or C++. This ensures that the data is placed in the read-only data section of the executable, typically the `.rodata` section.

### Example in C/C++

Here's an example of how to place initialized data in a read-only segment using the `const` keyword:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Initialized data in read-only segment
const char* message = "Hello, World!";

int main() {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `message` variable is declared as `const`, which ensures that it is placed in the read-only data segment.

### Verifying the Read-Only Segment

You can verify that the data is placed in the read-only segment by examining the sections of the compiled binary using the `readelf` or `objdump` tools.

#### Using `readelf`

```sh
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp
readelf -S my_program | grep rodata
```

#### Using `objdump`

```sh
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp
objdump -h my_program | grep rodata
```

### Example Output

The output should show a section named `.rodata`, indicating that the read-only data is placed in this segment.

```sh
  [15] .rodata           PROGBITS        0000000000402000  00002000
```

### Summary

By using the `const` keyword in C or C++, you can place initialized data in a read-only segment on Linux.
 This ensures that the data is placed in the `.rodata` section of the executable. You can verify this by 
 examining the sections of the compiled binary using tools like `readelf` or `objdump`. 
 The provided example demonstrates how to declare read-only data and verify its placement in the read-only segment.

 To explicitly place initialized data in a read-only segment, you can use the __attribute__((section(".rodata"))) attribute in GCC. This attribute allows you to specify the section where the variable should be placed.

Example in C/C++
Here's an example of how to explicitly place initialized data in the .rodata section using the __attribute__((section(".rodata"))) attribute:

```c++
#include <iostream>

// Explicitly place initialized data in the .rodata section
const char* message __attribute__((section(".rodata"))) = "Hello, World!";

int main() {
    std::cout << message << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
